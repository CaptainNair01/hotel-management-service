# Project Description

Developed a hotel room management system using Sanity.IO, handling everything from room setup to maintenance with easy-to-use CRUD operations. Implemented a room booking system with Stripe integration for secure and efficient reservation processes, allowing guests to make hassle-free payments. Ensured secure user access with Auth.JS for authentication and utilized TypeScript for reliable code structure, contributing to a robust and maintainable project


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
